The AirBnB_clone is a complete web application, integrating database storage,
a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

This project for now  only implements the back-en\
d console.

The console is a command line interpreter that pe\
rmits management of the backend
of HolbertonBnB. It can be used to handle and man\
ipulate all classes utilized by
the application (achieved by calls on the `storag\
e` object defined above).
